                <p>The expandable card shows how small design choices affect user agency. 
                    Flexbox creates a clean layout that adapts to different screens, 
                    giving a consistent experience. By hiding the details until the button is clicked, 
                    people gain control over how much information they see. 
                    This helps people who want quick summaries or less words, 
                    but it can be not as good for those who need full context or 
                    who may not notice the hidden content. Even a simple click requirement changes who 
                    finds the interface easy versus who finds it harder.
                    
                    On a bigger scale, hiding and revealing information shows power in digital design. 
                    Designers decide what is shown first and what is not, deciding what feels 
                    important. In certain projects, this choice determines what is shown overall
                    and what may not be considered key details. While not shown content can reduce overload, it can 
                    also be hard to access soemtimes. These small things grow up to influence inclusion 
                    and trust in the digital world.
