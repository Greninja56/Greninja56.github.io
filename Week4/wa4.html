                Contrast between dark text and light background is strong and easy to read. Headings and navigation are clear, 
                zooming in keeps content readable since your layout is simple and centered. Navigation works with keyboard input, and links are reachable. 
                However, for focus states it would help to make them more visually distinct . The aria attribute is good, but adding a stronger visual cue 
                for the active page would improve clarity. Typography is readable with good line spacing, and the consistent layout makes it easy to follow. 
                The cards on the Projects page are a nice touch and enhance the hierarchy. The design feels little and professional, though using your accent 
                color more could better express your personality and identity.

                For next week, more colors, and maybe just more info so it looks better and not just thrown together.
