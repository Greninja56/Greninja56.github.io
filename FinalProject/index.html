            <p class="about-text">
                The name’s Thomas, and I like to consider myself an entertainer! Entertainment
                comes from a lot of things for me — sports, games, stories — all things I’ve woven my
                own touch into.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                I’ve had the amazing experience of playing soccer for nearly my entire life, just
                under 20 years now. I’ve been lucky enough to represent my club teams, my high
                school team, and even my college club team, competing both at home and in other
                states.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                I wouldn’t say COVID was one of my favorite times, but it did bring me one of my
                most-loved activities: writing! Primarily feel-good fiction, I write stories about
                my favorite created duo and their adventures, the thrill of a high-seas pirate,
                and characters whose sole purpose is to break the fourth wall. I enjoy using
                themes of loyalty, perseverance, loss, and rebirth to define my stories and myself.
