        The CU Overwatch Hub was designed to provide Colorado University players, supporters, 
        and prospective team members with a centralized, accessible space to view rosters, track players, 
        and find opportunities to join the team. Every technical decision was guided by the community’s 
        needs, emphasizing information accessibility, inclusive interaction, and user agency. CSS Grid was 
        used to structure the site in a way that highlights content based on priority rather than purely aesthetic 
        considerations. The homepage features a central hero section, a “quick access” sidebar for upcoming matches 
        and join links, and a features section outlining the hub’s core benefits. Named grid areas such as hero, quick, 
        and features ensure a logical reading flow and semantic clarity, while responsive adjustments allow the layout 
        to remain usable across laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

        The roster page employs a distinct grid layout optimized for browsing player cards. The filter section uses named 
        grid areas (search, role, team) to place key controls at the top, giving users immediate access to search and filtering tools. 
        The team grid displays player cards in flexible, auto-adjusting columns, allowing the roster to adapt naturally to different 
        screen widths. These two layouts differ both visually and functionally, creating tailored interfaces for different user tasks: 
        general information on the homepage and interactive exploration on the roster page. This content-first approach ensures that users 
        can find relevant information quickly without navigating through unnecessary decorative elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three core JavaScript features were implemented to directly serve community needs. The navigation toggle allows mobile users to expand and 
        collapse the menu using either a button click or keyboard input (Enter/Space), ensuring accessibility regardless of device or input method. 
        The roster filters and search feature enables community members to locate players by name, role, or team, giving them direct control over 
        how they interact with the roster. These features degrade gracefully, so the full roster remains visible if JavaScript fails. Follow buttons 
        allow users to mark players they want to track, updating the button text and aria-pressed state to provide immediate visual and screen-reader 
        feedback. All features were coded using querySelector and addEventListener, with multiple event types represented, and they include clear feedback for all interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site was tested with two community members: a CU Overwatch player and a student familiar with esports team websites. Both testers used the search and 
        filter system, tried the follow buttons, and navigated the site on mobile. One tester noted that the follow buttons did not clearly indicate whether a player was
         followed, while another suggested improving the descriptive labeling of filter inputs. Both testers confirmed that the navigation toggle worked well on mobile devices 
         and that the roster filters were intuitive. Based on this feedback, aria-pressed was added to follow buttons, filter input labels were clarified, and focus states were 
         enhanced. These changes improved accessibility, clarified feedback, and confirmed that the site’s core functionality works across devices and abilities.
      </p>

        No personal data is stored, and all interactive features operate entirely on the client side. Follow states exist only for the current session, and search and filter 
        operations do not track or save user information. Interactive elements were designed to give users control over their experience: they can filter, search, and follow players 
        without creating an account or sharing data, which reduces risk and fosters trust. User testing highlighted the importance of immediate feedback and accessibility, even for 
        seemingly minor interface elements, and progressive enhancement ensures that all essential information remains accessible even if scripts fail or connections are slow. If given 
        more time, additional features such as opt-in match notifications and a secure preference-saving system could further enhance user experience, but the current site successfully 
        balances functionality, accessibility, and social responsibility.
